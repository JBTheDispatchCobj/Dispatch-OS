# Current State

## Running now (Olympic Sprint — Wave 1, 2026-07-21)
The first product vertical **RUNS end-to-end.** `cartridges/cooperative_markets/pipeline.ts`
(`runDealPipeline`) chains **ingest(5300) → score → IC memo → allocate → settle → assembleIO →
renderVariants → buildFeed** into one deterministic `DealRun`: every stage is routed through the
harness, emits a correlated `KernelEvent`, and records a `CostEntry`. The **human gate is real** —
a regulated conclusion (the IC memo) may not allocate/settle/publish until a caller-supplied
`ICApproval` disposes it `approved`; otherwise the run halts `awaiting_approval` (proven: unapproved
golden input publishes nothing; approved → settled, IO lifted to `human_approved_conclusion`).
`node scripts/pipeline-demo.ts` runs Halcyon × Summit end-to-end; the debug loop gained a PIPELINE
step and is **ALL GREEN (5/5)** with full-app `tsc` clean.

**Wave 2 (DONE):** the real **Terminal UI** is live at `/terminal` (`app/terminal/page.tsx` +
`components/terminal/TerminalView.tsx`) — it renders the live `runDealPipeline` output as a product
surface: harness stage rail with the human gate, institution + deal scorecards, the CEO/CRO/CFO
executive-lens toggle over `buildFeed`, IC memo, allocation, settlement/monitoring, and the kernel
spine. Gate: `npm run build` exit 0 (`/terminal` prerenders) + debug-loop green + `tsc` clean.
Next: **Wave 3 — live NCUA data at scale + kernel/truth services** (Object Registry service gated on
Bryan applying `0016`+`0017`; the ingestion + profile-assembly path proceeds now).

## Existing foundation
- Next.js app; Supabase/Postgres adapter + migrations (`0001`–`0015` applied;
  **`0016_market_rls.sql` and `0017_object_registry.sql` written + validated, pending apply**).
- Org/workspace scaffolding; generic (now plane-aware) entities; work items, evidence,
  proposals, approvals, reports, metrics, outcomes; rules; agent runs; widgets.
- Wealth, field-service, and (generic, non-vertical) hospitality example cartridges,
  **plus a `financial_services` base package installing 341 canonical object classes as
  entity_types** (config-as-data: `core/registry/data/financial_services_objects.json` +
  `core/registry/objects.ts`).
- **First product vertical: the `cooperative_markets` cartridge**
  (`cartridges/cooperative_markets/cartridge.ts`) — a full config-as-data
  `PackagedConfiguration` on the FS base + Volume XI ontology: 10 vertical entities (9 +
  reserved vendor) mapped to canonical `schema_ref`s; 11 workflows on the discovery→…→
  investment ladder + call-report ingestion + regulatory-impact review; rules/generationRules,
  evidence/approval, metrics (sourced inferences), outcomes, agent instructions, reports,
  dashboards, knowledge. Registered; strict `tsc` clean. It is the installed product
  *definition* — no ingestion/seed/engine/UI runs the loop yet.
- **Vertical scope (ADR-0015):** the finance / VC / CU / fintech / innovation stack.
  Hospitality descoped as a product vertical.

## Governance
- **Dispatch Constitution V1** (Volume I); Art. 18 routing ladder amended to the
  canonical 9-rung (V1.1 erratum, ADR-0011).
- **Specification Program fully reconciled/adopted (Vols I–X).** Authored specs of
  record: Kernel Vol II (`volumes/kernel/`, RFC-2000..2015) and Vols III–VII
  (`volumes/{knowledge_graph,agent_harness,cooperative_markets,auric_engine,terminal}/`).
- ADRs: 0004 plane graph · 0005 truth envelope · 0006 DKR · 0007 truth reconciliation ·
  0008 Constitution V1 · 0009 Vol 3/8/9 · 0010 Vol 5/6/10 · 0011 Kernel Vol II ·
  0012 Vols III–VII adopted · 0013 Vols VIII–X adopted + spec-program numbering
  (VIII=Execution Engine [new], IX=Connector, X=Object Registry; Cartridge SDK→kernel) ·
  **0014 Volume XI Canonical Ontology** (ontology layer over the Object Registry) ·
  **0015 Vertical scope** (finance/VC/CU/fintech/innovation; Hospitality descoped).
- **Remaining plan of record:** `DISPATCH_OS_REMAINING_ROADMAP.md` (Sprints 1–10 —
  knowledge encoding: ontology, truth models, rule/workflow/agent/connector/KPI/knowledge-pack
  libraries, reports, institution graph). Sprint 1 = Volume XI (in progress).

## Implemented contracts (code + applied Supabase)
Truth (`core/truth` + `0011`), Relationships (`0012`), Intelligence (`0013`),
Personal profiles (`0014`), DKR registry (`0015`). RLS (`0016`) + Object Registry identity
index (`0017`) written + validated (full `0001`–`0017` chain applies on Postgres 16), not yet
applied. Object Registry catalog + loader live in code; **Volume XI ontology** framework
(`core/registry/ontology.ts`) + **8 packs / 181 enriched objects, closed graph** (0
unresolved, 0 collisions): Credit Union (13), Lending & Deposits (30), Capital Markets &
Institutions (54), Innovation Ecosystem (16), Compliance (19), Regulation (15),
Technology/Vendor (24), AI (10). `scripts/ontology-check.mjs` runs the closed-graph check
(strict `tsc` clean over the ontology cone). **Sprint-1 ontology is complete** across the
ADR-0015 in-scope finance/VC/CU/fintech/innovation domains.

## Key reconciliation outcomes
- No code/migration churn from Vol adoption; all volume work is additive-forward.
- **Fact** = projection over verified-tier assertions + `Verification` (ADR-0005/0007
  intact); multi-source materialized fact store on the Volume III roadmap (ADR-0012).
- **Canonical Entity Model + entity resolution** (RFC-3002) is the top build bridge —
  incl. relaxing `entities.workspace_id` to nullable + plane/visibility.
- Kernel direction: unified event bus (RFC-2004) + cost/usage ledger (RFC-2008);
  portable cross-org identity (RFC-2002).
- Vocabulary reconciled onto canonical models (Fact→tier; Tenant→org/workspace/plane;
  RFC visibility→committed enum; Vol 7 UI "Workspace"→rename to avoid collision).

## Repos / backends
- GitHub: `JBTheDispatchCobj/Dispatch-OS` and `-Knowledge-Registry`, both `main`.
- Supabase: `0011`–`0015` applied (16 tables). Apply `0016` (RLS) next.

## Current priority
Apply `0016` + `0017` in Supabase (pending). Canonical Entity Model / Object Registry index
is now built (`0017` + catalog + loader). **Volume XI Canonical Ontology (roadmap Sprint 1)
is complete** — all 8 in-scope packs authored (Credit Union, Lending & Deposits, Capital
Markets & Institutions, Innovation Ecosystem, Compliance, Regulation, Technology/Vendor, AI;
181 objects, closed graph). **The Cooperative Markets cartridge (first product vertical) is
authored, seeded, and demoable**, and the **Auric executive-lens slice is proven**:
`cartridges/cooperative_markets/seed.ts` runs a full operating loop (5300 intake → agent flag
→ approved pilot), and `auric_lens.ts` + `auric_lens_demo.html` show one sourced insight
rendered base/CEO/CLO from identical `source_refs` (the CEO≠CLO thesis). All `tsc` clean.
Next thread, in order: (1) the **VC deal engine** (automated startup intake → score-against-
market → IC memo) — spec then build on the cartridge's diligence/investment workflows;
(2) wire a **live intake path** (call-report/startup ingestion) so the loop runs on real data,
not seed data; (3) apply `0016` + `0017` in Supabase, then the **Object Registry service**
(RFC-2003) and Identity & Tenancy (RFC-2002).
